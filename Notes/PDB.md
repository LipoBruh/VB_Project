# Notes on .PBD files

### ATOM rows

If we take for example a row extracted from the .pdb file in the directory, we can study this entry:

Record  Atom Name Residue  Protein Residue      X      Y      Z    Occupancy  Temperature    Symbol   Charge
Type      ID                Chain    ID
`ATOM     30  CA  LEU        A        4      -3.913 -78.072  49.981  1.00       20.96         C           `
